# Next.js Route Conflict Fix

## Issue
```
Error: ./src/app
An issue occurred while preparing your Next.js app
Conflicting route and page at /admin: route at /admin/route and page at /admin/page
```

## Root Cause
The `/admin` directory contained conflicting files:
- `page.tsx` - Next.js page component
- `route.tsx` - Incorrectly named route handler (should be `route.ts/js` for API routes)
- `route-handler.tsx` - Another duplicate file

Next.js cannot have both a page component and a route handler at the same path. This creates a routing conflict during compilation.

## Solution
**Removed the conflicting files:**
- Deleted `src/app/admin/route.tsx`
- Deleted `src/app/admin/route-handler.tsx`
- Kept `src/app/admin/page.tsx` (the correct approach for this use case)

## Technical Details

### What Each File Was Doing
All three files were essentially doing the same thing - redirecting users based on authentication status:

```tsx
// All files had similar logic:
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading) {
    if (!user) {
      router.push('/admin/login');
    } else if (['admin', 'super-admin', 'website-editor'].includes(user.role)) {
      router.push('/admin/dashboard');
    } else {
      router.push('/');
    }
  }
}, [user, loading, router]);
```

### Why `page.tsx` is the Correct Approach
- **Page components** (`page.tsx`) are for rendering UI and handling client-side logic
- **Route handlers** (`route.ts/js`) are for API endpoints and server-side logic
- Since we need client-side authentication checking and redirects, `page.tsx` is appropriate

### Next.js File Naming Conventions
- `page.tsx/jsx` - Page components (UI)
- `route.ts/js` - API route handlers (server-side)
- `layout.tsx/jsx` - Layout components
- `loading.tsx/jsx` - Loading UI
- `error.tsx/jsx` - Error UI

## Current Status
✅ **Conflict Resolved**: No more route/page conflicts
✅ **Server Running**: Frontend dev server running on http://localhost:3001
✅ **Admin Routes Working**: All admin routes functioning properly
✅ **Authentication Flow**: Proper redirect logic maintained

## Testing
- `/admin` - Redirects to login or dashboard based on auth status
- `/admin/login` - Admin login page loads correctly
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard accessible with proper auth
- All other admin routes function normally

The application is now working without the Next.js compilation conflict.
