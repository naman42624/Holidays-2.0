# Flight and Hotel Booking Flow Implementation Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Flight Card Baggage Display Issue**
- **Problem**: Flight card was showing "Cabin: undefined undefined" and "Checked: undefined undefined"
- **Solution**: Fixed the `getBaggageInfo` function in `FlightCard.tsx` to handle missing baggage data gracefully
- **Changes**: Updated logic to provide default values when baggage info is not available from API

### 2. **Search Suggestions Box Size Issue**
- **Problem**: Search suggestion box was too small and city names were trimmed
- **Solution**: Increased minimum width from 400px to 500px in `SearchSuggestions.tsx`
- **Changes**: Updated `min-w-[400px]` to `min-w-[500px]` for better display

### 3. **Flight Loader Width Issue**
- **Problem**: Flight loader didn't take full display width
- **Solution**: Updated `FlightLoader.tsx` to use full width
- **Changes**: Added `w-full` class and updated CSS to use `--w: 100%` instead of `min(700px, 90vw)`
