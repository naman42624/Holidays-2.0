# Node.js and Next.js Development Instructions

## Project Context
This workspace contains Node.js and Next.js setup guides and sample projects for a new laptop development environment.

## Code Style and Standards
- Use TypeScript for all React components and Next.js pages
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with utility classes
- Implement proper TypeScript interfaces and types
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Follow Next.js 14+ App Router conventions

## File Structure Preferences
- Place components in `src/components/` directory
- Use `src/app/` for Next.js App Router pages and layouts
- Create custom hooks in `src/hooks/` directory
- Place utilities in `src/utils/` directory
- Store types in `src/types/` directory

## Next.js Specific Guidelines
- Use Server Components by default, Client Components when needed
- Implement proper metadata for SEO
- Use Next.js Image component for optimized images
- Implement proper error boundaries and loading states
- Use Next.js built-in features like routing, API routes, and middleware

## Development Best Practices
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Add appropriate TypeScript types and interfaces
- Include proper error handling and validation
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic

## Dependencies and Libraries
- Prefer official Next.js and React patterns
- Use established libraries from the React ecosystem
- Suggest modern alternatives when appropriate
- Consider bundle size and performance implications
