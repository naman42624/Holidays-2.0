# Password Comparison Issue - Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status: Still investigating password comparison failure

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Run Enhanced Test Script
```bash
cd backend
node test-login.js
```

This will:
- Test server connection
- Create a brand new user (to avoid double-hash issues)
- Test login with fresh user
- Test with existing users
- Provide detailed error analysis

### 2. Debug Existing Users
```bash
cd backend
node debug-users.js debug
```

This will:
- Show all users in the database
- Display their password hashes
- Identify potential double-hashed passwords
- Test common passwords

### 3. Reset a Specific User's Password
```bash
cd backend
node debug-users.js reset test@example.com password123
```

This will:
- Properly hash and update the user's password
- Test the new password immediately

## What to Look For

### In Server Logs:
1. **Login attempt for:** [email]
2. **User found:** [email or "No user found"]
3. **Raw password entered:** [password]
4. **Stored password hash:** [hash]
5. **Hash length:** [should be ~60 characters]
6. **Hash starts with $2:** [should be true]
7. **User model comparePassword called**
8. **bcrypt.compare result:** [should be true]

### Expected Hash Format:
- Length: ~60 characters
- Starts with: `$2a$12$` or `$2b$12$`
- Example: `$2a$12$abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`

### Problem Indicators:
- Hash length != 60 characters
- Hash doesn't start with `$2`
- Hash is too long (double-hashed)
- Hash is too short (plaintext)

## Potential Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Double-Hashed Passwords (Most Likely)
**Symptoms:**
- Existing users can't login
- Fresh users work fine
- Hash looks weird/too long

**Solution:**
```bash
node debug-users.js reset [email] [password]
```

### Issue 2: User Model Pre-Save Hook Issue
**Symptoms:**
- Even fresh users fail
- Hash format is wrong

**Solution:**
Check the User model's pre-save hook for conflicts.

### Issue 3: bcrypt Version Mismatch
**Symptoms:**
- Inconsistent behavior
- Some users work, others don't

**Solution:**
Update bcrypt dependencies and rehash passwords.

### Issue 4: Salt Round Mismatch
**Symptoms:**
- Passwords fail even with correct hash format

**Solution:**
Ensure consistent salt rounds (currently 12).

## Quick Fix Commands

### For Testing (Create Fresh User Every Time):
```bash
# This avoids double-hash issues by creating new users
node test-login.js
```

### For Production (Fix Existing Users):
```bash
# Debug all users first
node debug-users.js debug

# Reset specific users
node debug-users.js reset user@example.com newpassword
```

## Code Changes Made

### Enhanced Debugging in auth.service.ts:
- Added detailed password comparison logging
- Shows hash format and length
- Tests both User model and direct bcrypt methods
- Provides specific error messages

### Enhanced Debugging in User.ts:
- Added logging to comparePassword method
- Shows exactly what bcrypt.compare receives and returns

### Created Utility Scripts:
- `test-login.js`: Comprehensive login testing
- `debug-users.js`: Database user debugging and password reset

## Next Steps

1. **Run the test script** to see detailed logs
2. **Check the server console** for debugging output
3. **If fresh users fail**: Issue is in the User model or bcrypt setup
4. **If only existing users fail**: Issue is double-hashed passwords
5. **Run debug-users.js** to inspect database directly
6. **Reset problematic users** with the debug script

## Expected Test Results

### Fresh User Test Should Show:
```
‚úÖ Fresh user registration successful
‚úÖ Login successful
‚úÖ Profile access successful
```

### Existing User Test Might Show:
```
‚ùå Existing user login failed: Invalid email or password
This is likely due to double-hashed password from previous registrations
üîß To fix existing user, run: node debug-users.js reset test@example.com password123
```
