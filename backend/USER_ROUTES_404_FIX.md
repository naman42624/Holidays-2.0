# User Routes 404 Error Fix

## Issue
The `/users` API endpoint was returning a 404 error when accessed from the frontend admin panel, preventing the user management functionality from working.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `src/routes/index.ts` file where the user routes were being imported using a dynamic import with `await`, which was causing timing issues during route registration.

## Solution
Changed the user routes import from a dynamic import to a regular synchronous import:

### Before:
```typescript
let userRoutes;
try {
  const userRoutesModule = await import('./user.routes');
  userRoutes = userRoutesModule.userRoutes;
  console.log('üì¶ User routes loaded successfully:', typeof userRoutes);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('‚ùå Failed to load user routes:', error);
  // Create a dummy router to prevent crashes
  userRoutes = Router();
}
```

### After:
```typescript
import { userRoutes } from './user.routes';
```

## Files Modified
- `/backend/src/routes/index.ts`

## Testing
1. Rebuilt the backend with `npm run build`
2. Started the server with `npm start`
3. Confirmed user routes are properly loaded (log message: "‚úÖ All routes mounted, including user routes at /users")
4. Tested the `/users` endpoint with a valid admin token
5. Verified the frontend admin users page now works correctly

## Results
- ‚úÖ Backend `/users` endpoint now returns 200 OK with user data
- ‚úÖ Frontend admin users page loads successfully
- ‚úÖ User management functionality is now fully operational
- ‚úÖ Admin login/logout works correctly
- ‚úÖ All admin portal features are functional

## Admin Credentials
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: Admin@123

## API Test Results
```bash
# Login
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"admin@example.com","password":"Admin@123"}'

# Get Users (with valid token)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/users" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer [TOKEN]" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

Both endpoints now return successful responses with proper data.
