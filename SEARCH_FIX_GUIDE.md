# Frontend Search Results Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Issue
Search results are not displaying on the frontend, even though data is successfully fetched from the backend.

## Changes Made to Fix the Issue

### 1. Backend Response Structure Fix
**Problem**: Backend was returning `{ data: { flights: [...] } }` but frontend expected `{ data: [...] }`

**Fix**: Updated `flight.controller.ts` to return flights directly in the data field:
```typescript
const response: ApiResponse = {
  success: true,
  data: transformedFlights, // Changed from { flights: transformedFlights }
  meta: { ... }
};
```

### 2. Flight Data Transformation Fix
**Problem**: Backend transformation didn't match frontend expectations

**Fix**: Updated `flight.service.ts` transformation to match frontend types:
```typescript
// OLD - didn't match frontend types:
departure: { airport: segment.departure.iataCode, time: segment.departure.at }

// NEW - matches frontend FlightSegment interface:
departure: { iataCode: segment.departure.iataCode, at: segment.departure.at }
```

### 3. Added Debugging and Logging
**Frontend**: Added console logs and debug section in development mode
**Backend**: Added comprehensive logging and mock data fallback

### 4. Environment Configuration
**Created**: `.env.local` file with correct API URL
**Added**: Console logging to verify API base URL

## Testing Steps

### 1. Start Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
```
Backend should start on `http://localhost:8000`

### 2. Start Frontend  
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```
Frontend should start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 3. Test Flight Search
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000/flights`
2. Enter search criteria:
   - From: "New York" or "NYC" 
   - To: "Los Angeles" or "LAX"
   - Departure date: Tomorrow's date
   - Adults: 1
3. Click "Search Flights"
4. Check browser console for debug logs
5. Look for debug section showing flight count and data

### 4. Check Debug Information
In development mode, you should see:
- API Base URL logged in console
- Search parameters logged before API call
- API response logged after successful call
- Debug section showing:
  - Is Searching: Yes/No
  - Flight Offers Count: [number]
  - Search Error: [error message or "None"]
  - Raw flight data (expandable)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: "Failed to search flights" Error
**Cause**: Backend not running or CORS issues
**Solution**: 
- Ensure backend is running on port 8000
- Check backend console for errors
- Verify CORS settings allow localhost:3000

### Issue 2: "No flights found" Message
**Cause**: Amadeus API issues or invalid search parameters
**Solution**:
- Check if mock data is returned (meta.mock: true)
- Verify IATA codes are valid (NYC -> JFK, LAX, etc.)
- Check Amadeus API credentials in backend

### Issue 3: API Connection Issues
**Cause**: Wrong API URL or network issues  
**Solution**:
- Check console for "API Base URL: http://localhost:8000/api"
- Verify `.env.local` file exists with correct URL
- Test backend directly: `curl http://localhost:8000/api/health`

### Issue 4: Frontend Shows Data But No Results Rendered
**Cause**: React rendering issues or data structure mismatch
**Solution**:
- Check debug section shows flight count > 0
- Verify flightOffers state is populated
- Check for React rendering errors in console

## File Changes Summary

### Backend Files Modified:
- `src/controllers/flight.controller.ts` - Fixed response structure and added logging
- `src/services/flight.service.ts` - Fixed data transformation 
- `src/types/amadeus.ts` - Updated ApiResponse meta type

### Frontend Files Modified:
- `src/app/flights/page.tsx` - Added debug logging and debug section
- `src/lib/api.ts` - Added response/error logging and API URL logging
- `.env.local` - Created with API URL configuration

## Next Steps if Issues Persist

1. **Test Backend Directly**:
   ```bash
   curl "http://localhost:8000/api/flights/search?originLocationCode=JFK&destinationLocationCode=LAX&departureDate=2025-07-06&adults=1"
   ```

2. **Check Browser Network Tab**: Look for failed requests or unexpected responses

3. **Verify Data Flow**: 
   - Backend logs show request received
   - Backend logs show response sent  
   - Frontend logs show response received
   - Frontend state updated with data
   - React renders the results

4. **Test with Mock Data**: The backend now returns mock data if Amadeus API fails, so you should always see at least one result.

The main fix was correcting the response structure mismatch between backend and frontend. The frontend now should correctly display search results!
