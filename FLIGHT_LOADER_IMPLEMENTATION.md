# Flight Search Loader Implementation

## Overview
Added a beautiful animated flight loader that displays during flight searches, showing the origin and destination cities with an animated airplane traveling between them.

## Features

### Visual Elements
- **Animated Airplane**: Moves along a progress track with scaling animation
- **Floating Clouds**: Multiple animated clouds for visual appeal
- **Progress Track**: Shows search progress with smooth animation
- **City Names**: Displays origin and destination cities prominently
- **Loading Text**: "Searching for the best flights..." with animated dots

### Technical Implementation
- **Continuous Animation**: Airplane loops from origin to destination
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
- **Smooth Transitions**: 80ms interval updates for fluid motion
- **CSS Animations**: Combines JavaScript progress with CSS animations
- **Tailwind Integration**: Uses Tailwind CSS classes for better project consistency

## Files Created

### 1. FlightLoader.tsx (Original Complex Version)
- Uses styled-jsx for complex CSS animations
- Based on the original HTML/CSS inspiration
- Features detailed airplane design with CSS gradients
- Includes cloud animations with masking effects

### 2. FlightLoaderSimple.tsx (Simplified Version - USED)
- Uses Tailwind CSS classes for better integration
- SVG airplane icon for cleaner rendering
- Simplified cloud animations
- Better mobile responsiveness

## Integration Points

### Flights Page Integration
```tsx
// Added state to track search parameters
const [searchParams, setSearchParams] = useState<{origin: string, destination: string} | null>(null)

// Extract city names during search
const onSubmit = async (data: FlightSearchFormData) => {
  const extractCityName = (locationString: string) => {
    const cityMatch = locationString.match(/^(.+?)\s*\([A-Z]{3}\)/)
    if (cityMatch) {
      return cityMatch[1].trim()
    }
    return locationString.replace(/\([^)]*\)/g, '').trim() || locationString
  }

  const originCity = extractCityName(data.from)
  const destinationCity = extractCityName(data.to)
  
  setSearchParams({ origin: originCity, destination: destinationCity })
  // ... rest of search logic
}

// Display loader during search
{isSearching && searchParams && (
  <FlightLoader 
    origin={searchParams.origin}
    destination={searchParams.destination}
    className="mb-8"
  />
)}
```

### City Name Extraction Logic
- Handles format: "City Name (CODE)" → extracts "City Name"
- Fallback: uses the full string if no parentheses found
- Cleans up extra whitespace and formatting

## Animation Details

### Airplane Movement
- Progress: 0% to 100% continuously looping
- Scale Effect: `1 + 0.3 * sin(π * progress / 100)` for size variation
- Drop Shadow: Dynamic shadow based on progress for depth effect

### Cloud Animations
- Multiple clouds with different speeds (0.7x, 0.5x, 0.3x of airplane speed)
- CSS `float` animation for vertical movement
- Staggered starting positions for natural distribution

### Loading Indicators
- Bouncing dots with staggered animation delays (0ms, 150ms, 300ms)
- Smooth color transitions matching the theme

## Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Full feature set with clouds and detailed animations
- **Mobile**: Simplified layout, smaller airplane, optional cloud hiding
- **Accessibility**: Maintains contrast and readability across devices

## Usage Example
```tsx
<FlightLoader 
  origin="New York" 
  destination="London" 
  className="my-8" 
/>
```

## Styling Theme
- **Background**: Sky gradient (sky-100 → sky-200 → blue-300)
- **Colors**: Blue theme matching flight branding
- **Typography**: Slate-700 for good contrast
- **Effects**: Drop shadows and transparency for depth

This implementation provides an engaging user experience during flight searches, clearly showing the search progress while maintaining the travel theme with animated visual elements.
