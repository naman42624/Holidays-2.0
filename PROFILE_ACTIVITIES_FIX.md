# Issues Fixed - Profile Protection & Activities Search

## Issue 1: Profile Route Protection âœ… FIXED

### Problem
The `/profile` page was not protected and users could access it without being logged in.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Added Route Protection
```typescript
// Route protection - redirect if not authenticated
useEffect(() => {
  if (!loading && !user) {
    router.push('/auth/login')
  }
}, [user, loading, router])
```

#### 2. Added Loading States
```typescript
// Show loading while checking authentication
if (loading) {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-50 flex items-center justify-center">
      <div className="flex items-center">
        <Loader2 className="w-6 h-6 mr-2 animate-spin" />
        Checking authentication...
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Profile Data Loading
- Uses user data from AuthContext as primary source
- Falls back to API call for fresh data
- Handles errors gracefully

### Result
- âœ… Unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth/login`
- âœ… Profile loads user data correctly
- âœ… Shows appropriate loading states
- âœ… Protected route works as expected

## Issue 2: Activities Search Location Handling âœ… FIXED

### Problem
Activities search required latitude/longitude coordinates but users were entering text destinations without proper validation/conversion.

### Root Cause
The Amadeus Activities API requires coordinates (lat/lng) but users naturally want to search by city names.

### Solution Applied

#### 1. Enhanced Location-to-Coordinates Logic
```typescript
// First check if user selected a location from suggestions
let matchingLocation = selectedLocation

// If no selected location, try to find from suggestions
if (!matchingLocation) {
  matchingLocation = locationSuggestions.find(loc => 
    data.destination.toLowerCase().includes(loc.city.toLowerCase()) ||
    data.destination.toLowerCase().includes(loc.name.toLowerCase())
  ) || null
}

// If still no matching location, search via API
if (!matchingLocation) {
  const locationResponse = await api.get(`${endpoints.locations.search}?keyword=${encodeURIComponent(data.destination)}&subType=CITY&limit=1`)
  // ... handle response
}

// If still no coordinates, show helpful error
if (!matchingLocation || !matchingLocation.coordinates) {
  setSearchError(`Could not find coordinates for "${data.destination}". Please select a location from the suggestions or try a different destination.`)
  return
}
```

#### 2. Improved User Experience
- **Better placeholder text**: "Type city name (e.g., Paris, New York, Tokyo)"
- **Visual feedback**: Green border and checkmark when location is properly selected
- **Helpful hints**: Guide users to select from suggestions
- **Smart location tracking**: Remembers when user selects from dropdown vs typing manually

#### 3. Location Selection Feedback
```typescript
{selectedLocation ? (
  <p className="mt-1 text-xs text-green-600">
    âœ… Location selected: {selectedLocation.city}, {selectedLocation.country}
  </p>
) : (
  <p className="mt-1 text-xs text-gray-500">
    ðŸ’¡ Start typing and select a city from the suggestions for best results
  </p>
)}
```

#### 4. Three-Tier Location Resolution
1. **Primary**: Use location selected from suggestions dropdown
2. **Secondary**: Match typed text against cached suggestions
3. **Fallback**: Search for location via API
4. **Error**: Clear message if no coordinates found

### Result
- âœ… Users get clear guidance on how to enter destinations
- âœ… Visual feedback when location is properly selected
- âœ… Automatic coordinate resolution for valid locations
- âœ… Helpful error messages for invalid locations
- âœ… Activities API gets proper latitude/longitude coordinates

## Files Modified

### Profile Protection:
- `/frontend/src/app/profile/page.tsx`
  - Added route protection
  - Enhanced authentication loading states
  - Improved user data handling

### Activities Search:
- `/frontend/src/app/activities/page.tsx`
  - Enhanced location-to-coordinates conversion
  - Added visual feedback for location selection

## Testing Instructions

### Test Profile Protection:
1. **Logged Out State**:
   - Navigate to `/profile` while logged out
   - Should redirect to `/auth/login`

2. **Logged In State**:
   - Login first
   - Navigate to `/profile`
   - Should show profile form with user data populated

### Test Activities Search:
1. **Proper Location Selection**:
   - Go to `/activities`
   - Type "Paris" in destination field
   - Select "Paris, France" from dropdown
   - Should show green border and checkmark
   - Search should work with coordinates

2. **Manual Typing**:
   - Type "London" and search without selecting from dropdown
   - Should attempt to find coordinates automatically
   - Should work if location is found

3. **Invalid Location**:
   - Type "InvalidCityName123"
   - Should show error message about not finding coordinates
   - Should prompt user to select from suggestions

## Expected User Flow

### Profile Access:
```
User not logged in â†’ /profile â†’ Redirect to /auth/login
User logged in â†’ /profile â†’ Show profile form with data
```

### Activities Search:
```
Type city name â†’ See suggestions â†’ Select from dropdown â†’ Green feedback â†’ Search works
Type city name â†’ Don't select â†’ Auto-search â†’ Works if valid location
Type invalid name â†’ Auto-search fails â†’ Clear error message
```

Both issues are now resolved with proper error handling, user guidance, and fallback mechanisms!
