# Profile Form Population Fix

## Issue
The profile form in `/profile` was not being populated with user data after login.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Backend Data Structure Issue
- The User model in MongoDB defined `profile` and `preferences` fields
- But existing users in the database did not have these fields initialized
- This caused the profile endpoint to return incomplete user data

### 2. Frontend Form Issues
- The form was using `setValue()` calls but may not have been properly configured
- Missing default values in the form configuration
- The form was trying to access nested objects that didn't exist

## Solution Implemented

### Backend Fixes
1. **Database Migration**: Created `fix-user-profiles.js` script to update all existing users
   - Added missing `profile` field with default values
   - Ensured all users have the complete data structure

2. **Verification**: Backend API now returns complete user data:
   ```json
   {
     "success": true,
     "data": {
       "user": {
         "firstName": "Test",
         "lastName": "User",
         "email": "test@example.com",
         "preferences": {
           "currency": "INR",
           "language": "en",
           "timezone": "UTC"
         },
         "profile": {
           "phone": "",
           "dateOfBirth": null,
           "address": {
             "street": "",
             "city": "",
             "country": "",
             "postalCode": ""
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

### Frontend Fixes
1. **Form Configuration**: Added proper default values to the form:
   ```typescript
   const { register, handleSubmit, setValue, watch } = useForm<ProfileFormData>({
     resolver: zodResolver(profileSchema),
     defaultValues: {
       firstName: '',
       lastName: '',
       email: '',
       phone: '',
       dateOfBirth: '',
       address: { street: '', city: '', country: '', postalCode: '' },
       preferences: { currency: 'INR', language: 'en', timezone: 'UTC' }
     }
   })
   ```

2. **Improved Data Handling**: Enhanced the setValue calls to handle both response formats:
   ```typescript
   const userData = (data.data as any).user || data.data // Handle both response formats
   
   // Set form values with proper fallbacks
   setValue('firstName', userData.firstName || '')
   setValue('lastName', userData.lastName || '')
   // ... other fields with proper null checking
   ```

3. **Enhanced Debugging**: Added comprehensive logging and debug display:
   - Console logging of API responses
   - Debug panel showing current form values
   - Proper error handling and fallbacks

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `fix-user-profiles.js` - Database migration script
- Verified existing auth controller and service are working correctly

### Frontend
- `src/app/profile/page.tsx` - Enhanced form configuration and data handling
- `src/app/debug-profile/page.tsx` - Added debug page for troubleshooting

## Testing
- Backend endpoints tested and working correctly
- User data structure verified in database
- Form should now populate correctly with user data

## Next Steps
1. Test the frontend profile form with a user login
2. Verify all form fields are populated correctly
3. Test form submission and profile updates
4. Remove debug code once confirmed working

## Commands to Test
```bash
# Backend (should already be running)
cd backend && npm run dev

# Frontend
cd frontend && npm run dev

# Navigate to /profile after logging in with:
# Email: test@example.com
# Password: password123
```
